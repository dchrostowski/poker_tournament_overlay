# SWC Poker Standings

This react app is intended to be used for Twitch streams and will show a leaderboard of any ChefCatRadio tournaments being played on swcpoker.club.

## How to use/run locally

I plan to eventually publish this app on my personal website, but until then here's how to make this work:

1. [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
2. `git clone https://github.com/dchrostowski/swc_tournament_rankings`
3. `cd swc_tournament_rankings`
4. `yarn install`
5. `yarn start`
6. Open OBS Studio, configure a new browser plugin source, set the URL to localhost:3000
7. Adjust as you see fit.
